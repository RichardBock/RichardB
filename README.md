### Code.org GameLab
[Robot Face](https://RichardBock.github.io/RobotFace/)
> In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

 [Caption Scene](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/UCoNqMH44s7EvHvrgHZhANAUE9TRbf-QycO1poYFNfA)
 >  A creative project of this unit. Using the problem-solving process as a model

[Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/SEYCe_W5Sz4vmzzjPWfOQEHKqiTSrVTnQcVI22KzfOI)
 >  In this project my partner and I used sprites with different properties, and we used conditionals and user inputs to affect the code

[Side Scroller Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/f2-OhcOxGVpeTMhwKo5dxX3lR_ubnPxnGgpyrmAmx8Q)
> In this project my partner and I used sprites with different properties, and we used conditionals to control the score and player inputs to affect the code

[Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/K135CDNtmCFL1GZuM1nBAcN2wVOLmVRydMBPeE0NT-4)
> In this project my partner and I used velocity counter patterns to simulate gravity to create a flyer game

[Platform Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/3ScFMW-12kzDGr-hciYoiTIZIAa1ne2gr1s4isWVN-k)
> In this project my partner and I used sprites with different properties like collide in order to stand on the platform, and we used functions to make the code more put together and easier to read

[Final Game Project](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/Q8MuFd2_BbXDlyLkudo1xtxFaeUgHdzQztiOp2V-KVw)
> In this project I used different types of functions to control the background, player movements, and much more to create a unique game that isn't too hard or too easy

### App Inventor

[HelloItsMe](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=b7e648de-55ac-40b4-b78a-286493776a5f)
> In this app I used buttons to activate players in order to make sounds once you press the image

[PianoApp](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=4ac7f608-80d6-420f-9b0d-9b740ac4c5e3)
>In this app I used different colored buttons to activate players to make the sounds of a piano

[MusicMakerApp](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=8e5e411b-0941-48bf-a69d-2e16c47a714b)
> In this app I found different sounds of instruments and applied them to medias so when you click on the image of the instrument it plays their sound.  There is also a recording button so when they sounds play it records it for later.

[FindTheGoldApp](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=b3f42adc-6c21-4f92-a6b3-b9f6a9cc1216)
> In this app we cooperated with a partner to create a maze game using an accelerometer to move the ball and a notifier to detech when the ball has touch the goal.

[DogChase](https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=ecbdec68-3281-44f4-83bc-4efdc9ba95e4)
> In this app we worked as partners used conditionals, tinydb's, and image sprites to create a fully working game so when you flick the red dot it will move hit the goal so you gain score but be aware to dodge the green dot.

### CMU Academy
[CreativeTask1](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/greyRabbit8086)
> In this project, I used python to code a soccer stadium using different kinds of shapes, colors, gradients, and opacities

[CreativeTask2](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/greyKitten5835)
> In this project, We worked in partners to create an animated scene by using mouse clicks and varibles

[CreativeTask3](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/burlyWoodBird2773)
> In this project, We worked in partners to create an animated scene by using mouse movements, varibles, and grouping
